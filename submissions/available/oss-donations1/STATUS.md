# oss-donations
This is the
complete replication package for an empirical study of donations in open source. A pre-print of the paper, "How to Not Get Rich: An Empirical Study of Donations in Open Source" can be found [here](icse20donations.pdf).

## Applying for the Reusable and Available Badges
We are applying for the Reusable and Available badges for the following reasons:
* Our analysis is available via GitHub. We placed it on a publicly accessible archival repository.
* The README of the public repository contains explicit instructions on how to execute and reuse our analysis code.
* We carefully documented and structured our analysis files to increase comprehensibility.
* We made it very easy to reproduce our results by just having to run a single R file and 4 well-documented interactive Jupyter notebooks.
